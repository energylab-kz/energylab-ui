Effective tariff policy
<p>The purpose of the project: to study and analyze ways to form an effective tariff policy and new market mechanisms in the electric power industry of Kazakhstan with an increase in the share of renewable energy sources (RES) and digitalization of the sector by comparing different development scenarios; development of software or a web platform for the efficient operation of an electricity sales operator. The integration of renewable energy into energy systems has been made possible by the development of the power grid infrastructure, demand management measures (installation of multi-tariff meters and flexibility in electricity prices), the development of energy storage technologies, as well as industry cooperation and flexible generation of electricity in traditional power plants.
        
Energy balance in the market
<p class="fw-light mb-3">
  At the same time, the success in the development of RES and the rapid increase in its share in the energy balance were associated with large-scale state support provided to new technologies in developed countries. Purchases of green electricity at higher prices, subsidies to companies switching to the use of new technologies, significantly helped the industry in the early stages of development. The novelty of the study lies in the testing and integration of new systemic market mechanisms for the development of the electricity market with modern types of renewable energy sources and energy storage devices with computer scenario modeling tools. The research team will apply modern IT approaches in the field of scenario analysis and multi-agent modeling to form a new tariff policy in the electricity market. As a result of the project, it is expected to develop an optimization model of the Kazakhstani electricity market for testing and formation of a new tariff policy with a mechanism of transparent auctions between all participants. The scientific supervisor of the project is N.K. Zhakiev (PhD in physics).

Title
Application of modeling methods and machine learning for optimal planning of the composition of the generating equipment of the Pavlodar CHPP-1.

Tasks
<ul>
  <li>
    Collection and processing of telemetry data, ranges of operating
    modes, weather, digitization of processes, diagrams and drawings.
  </li>
  <li>
    Modeling of CHP and development of a machine learning algorithm for
    planning (short-term and long-term) maintenance and repairs of
    equipment.
  </li>
  <li>
    Development of recommendations for improving energy efficiency, for
    managing the reliability of CHP plants based on the Decision Tree.
  </li>
</ul>

Aim
The purpose is to study the potential for improving the energy efficiency of CHPPs, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and applying modeling and machine learning methods for optimal planning of the composition of the generating equipment of the CHPP in Pavlodar, Kazakhstan.

Project relevance
This study is important for the applied testing of methods for processing big data using machine learning methods coming from an industrial facility that generates electricity, heat, and industrial steam. Pavlodar CHPP is special in that it is located in the northern zone of Kazakhstan, and has two different consumers - an aluminum plant and the population. The complexity in the variability of the consumption profile requires the use of modern methods of predictive planning of the composition of generating equipment for the day, week, year ahead. The long service life of the units, the hours worked, requires constant adjustment of the repair plan for the year ahead. It is necessary to take into account the curve of dynamic demand for heat and electricity by forecasting methods depending on the weather, the variability of heat and electricity consumption is changed by probabilistic laws based on historical data on consumption of the population.

Results
In the process of working on a scientific project, a quantitative analysis of the data from CHPP-1 of Aluminum of Kazakhstan JSC was carried out. Various levels of loading of aggregates were analyzed, data clustering was carried out. A CHP model has been developed in the GAMS environment for optimal medium-term planning of the composition of generating equipment for the day ahead. The numerical results of the ARIMA and Decision Tree models show that the effectiveness of the proposed approach is manifested with a large uncertainty in demand, when the operating costs of the system and fuel consumption increase due to unplanned changes in generation. The advantages of the proposed model lie in the modeling of uncertainties in solving the stochastic long-term problem of choosing the composition of generating units. The developed algorithms can be used for other similar CHPPs.

              Energy system models are used to analyse long-term policies and pathways to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. It is necessary to create 'net zero' or 'net-negative emissions' energy systems that decarbonize the entire economy, covering energy supply and demand, as well as other sources of emissions, including industrial processes, agriculture, and land use. A subset of these models are engineering-economic models that minimize the costs of achieving exogenously given annual reductions in GHG emissions to limit the increase in average global temperature. Their results, called deep decarbonization models (DDMs), include levels and timing of energy investment that meet projections of future energy demand across all energy sectors over several decades.

              Kazakhstan's energy sector and economy as a whole are dependent on fossil fuels, with coal being the backbone of Kazakhstan's electricity sector, accounting for 67% of the country's electricity production and CO₂ emissions. The transition from fossil fuels to clean energy solutions for Kazakhstan is now high on the national strategy agenda. This requires a transformation of energy policy and a revision of traditional industrial development strategies, the introduction of innovative technologies and the application of “rapid decarbonization” measures. Energy modeling of development scenarios has an important role in shaping policy and investment decisions.

              Kazakhstan is a leading producer and exporter of fossil energy: the 9th largest exporter of coal, the 9th largest exporter of crude oil, and the 12th largest producer of natural gas [1,2]. The economy of Kazakhstan is largely dependent on energy production mainly from fossil fuels, energy-intensive industry and natural resource processing. Kazakhstan, a leading exporter of hydrocarbons, is currently faced with the need to decarbonize economic sectors and transition to a new energy paradigm based on the climate agenda. The transition from fossil fuels to clean energy solutions is now prominent in national strategic documents [3,4].

              A key factor in conducting this study are the environmental, economic and energy aspects of decarbonization of the national economy: (i) The Kazakhstan 2050 Strategy includes long-term goals to increase the share of alternative energy in electricity production (renewable and nuclear) to 50% by 2050; (ii) The strategy to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 is a trigger to attract significant investment in alternative energy sources. The country's regions have great potential for renewable energy: solar, wind, bio, hydro and geothermal energy; (iii) By leveraging the region's diverse energy sources and production mix, the pilot market will pave the way for accelerated regional decarbonization and realize the benefits of sustainable energy cooperation in CA. These benefits include lower investment costs for new generation capacity, increased development of renewable energy sources, and improved operation and management of regional energy resources.

              To transition to a renewable energy system, the following three steps are necessary. First, modernize and further develop networks capable of integrating a high share of renewable energy. Second, increasing the flexibility of the energy system through demand management, energy storage systems, hydropower capacity and other technologies. Third, a clear plan for phasing out coal, including support for structural changes in coal regions. Interest in renewable energy production is growing throughout the region, motivated by current energy needs and the implementation of long-term CC mitigation strategies. The global push for clean technologies demonstrates that the energy crisis is certainly not a setback for the climate, but rather is accelerating the energy transition. In fact, the IEA's WEO 2022 report leads us to the conclusion that the famous energy trilemma can be solved with clean energy, providing solutions for energy security, economic competitiveness and sustainability.

              LEAP is an integrated scenario-based modeling tool that can be used to track energy consumption, production and resource extraction across all sectors of the economy. It can be used to account for sources and sinks of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in both the energy and non-energy sectors. In addition to tracking GHG emissions, LEAP can also be used to analyze emissions of local and regional air pollutants, as well as short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs), making it well suited for studying the climate co-benefits of local air pollution reductions. The study will integrate DDPP, a collaborative initiative that aims to physically and economically demonstrate how countries can transform their energy systems to achieve deep decarbonization in line with national development priorities. This transition is represented by the deep decarbonization (DDM) pathways of individual countries. A key advantage of the approach is that country DDPs are prepared by in-country teams with local knowledge independent of government, with careful consideration of the national political, economic, technological, and geographic context.
